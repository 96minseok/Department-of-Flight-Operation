Torque and P-Factor
    To the pilot, “torque” (<u><strong>the left turning tendency</strong></U> of the
    airplane) is made up of four elements that cause or produce
    a twisting or rotating motion around at least one of the
    airplane’s three axes. These four elements are:

      Torque reaction involves Newton’s Third Law of Physics—
      for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. As
      applied to the aircraft, this means that as the internal engine
      parts and propeller are revolving in one direction, an equal
      force is trying to rotate the aircraft in the opposite direction.
