<p>
Torque and P-Factor
    To the pilot, “torque” (<u><strong>the left turning tendency</strong></U> of the
    airplane) is made up of four elements that cause or produce
    a twisting or rotating motion around at least one of the
    airplane’s three axes. These four elements are:

      target = "_blank" title = "torque_effect definition"> Torque reaction from engine and propeller.</a></strong><br>
      Torque reaction involves Newton’s Third Law of Physics—
      for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. As
      applied to the aircraft, this means that as the internal engine
      parts and propeller are revolving in one direction, an equal
      force is trying to rotate the aircraft in the opposite direction.

<strong>2.<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slipstream"
  target = "_blank" title = " slipstream definition"> Corkscrewing effect of the slipstream</a></strong><br>
The high-speed rotation of an aircraft propeller gives a
corkscrew or spiraling rotation to the slipstream. At high
propeller speeds and low forward speed (as in the takeoffs
and approaches to power-on stalls), this spiraling rotation
is very compact and exerts a strong sideward force on the
aircraft’s vertical tail surface.

<strong>3.<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope"> Gyroscopic action of the propeller</a></strong><br>
Before the gyroscopic effects of the propeller can be
understood, it is necessary to understand the basic principle
of a gyroscope. All practical applications of the gyroscope
are based upon two fundamental properties of gyroscopic
action: rigidity in space and precession. The one of interest
for this discussion is precession.

<strong>4.<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-factor"
  target = "_blank" title = "p-factor definition"> Asymmetric loading of the propeller (P-factor)</a></strong><br>
When an aircraft is flying with a high AOA, the “bite” of
the downward moving blade is greater than the “bite” of the
upward moving blade. This moves the center of thrust to the
right of the prop disc area, causing a yawing moment toward
the left around the vertical axis. Proving this explanation is
complex because it would be necessary to work wind vector
problems on each blade while considering both the AOA of
the aircraft and the AOA of each blade.
